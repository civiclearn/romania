    <h1>Conditions for Obtaining Romanian Citizenship</h1>

    <p>
      Romanian citizenship can be acquired through several pathways, including naturalization, citizenship by descent, and the recognition of multiple citizenships. These mechanisms reflect Romania’s evolving legal and demographic landscape, and they play an important role for both members of the Romanian diaspora and foreign nationals seeking integration within the European Union.
    </p>

    <p>
      Standard naturalization requires at least eight years of continuous legal residence in Romania, proficiency in the Romanian language, and a demonstrated understanding of the nation’s cultural and legal framework. Accelerated options exist for certain groups, such as refugees, individuals with notable contributions to Romania, and spouses of Romanian citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Citizenship by descent allows individuals with Romanian ancestry to restore citizenship, often for descendants of those who lost it involuntarily due to historical or territorial changes. This pathway has generated a high number of applications, reflecting ongoing ties between Romania and its historical communities abroad.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Citizenship</h2>

    <p>
      Romanian citizenship can be obtained through naturalization, descent, or specific legal provisions for particular categories of applicants.
    </p>

    <h2>Naturalization</h2>

    <p>
      Naturalization is available to foreign nationals who meet the residency, language, and integration requirements set by Romanian law.
    </p>

    <h3>Accelerated Eligibility</h3>

    <p>
      Refugees, individuals married to Romanian citizens, and applicants with significant contributions to the country may qualify for accelerated naturalization. For example, the spouse of a Romanian citizen may apply after five years of marriage and continuous legal residence.
    </p>

    <h2>Multiple Citizenship</h2>

    <p>
      Romania permits multiple citizenship. This provision is particularly important for applicants from countries such as Moldova, where Romanian citizenship offers access to European Union rights and mobility.
    </p>

    <h1>Eligibility Requirements</h1>

    <h2>Residency Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      Applicants must demonstrate at least eight years of continuous legal residence in Romania, with certain exceptions for refugees and stateless individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>Language Proficiency</h2>

    <p>
      Applicants must prove adequate knowledge of the Romanian language, usually through an exam or an accredited language course.
    </p>

    <h2>Knowledge of Romanian Culture and History</h2>

    <p>
      Understanding Romania’s culture and history is assessed during the citizenship interview conducted by relevant authorities.
    </p>

    <h2>Clean Criminal Record</h2>

    <p>
      A clean criminal record is mandatory and is verified through official background checks.
    </p>

    <h2>Financial Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      Applicants must show proof of legal and stable income to support themselves and their dependents.
    </p>

    <h1>Application Process</h1>

    <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      The application must be submitted in person at the National Authority for Citizenship. Documents issued abroad must be apostilled or super-legalized.
    </p>

    <h2>Required Documentation</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Birth and marriage certificates (apostilled or super-legalized)</li>
      <li>Proof of the spouse’s Romanian citizenship, if applicable</li>
      <li>Accommodation documents and land registry extracts</li>
      <li>Proof of income for the previous three years</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Application Review</h2>

    <p>
      Authorities may request additional documents or conduct an interview. Extended absences from Romania may negatively affect the application.
    </p>

    <h2>Processing Timeline</h2>

    <p>
      Processing may take from six months to three years, depending on case complexity and administrative workload.
    </p>

    <h1>Special Provisions</h1>

    <h2>High Court Involvement</h2>

    <p>
      Recent amendments to the Citizenship Law have prompted constitutional review by the High Court of Cassation and Justice and the Constitutional Court.
    </p>

    <h2>Citizenship by Descent</h2>

    <p>
      Individuals up to the third generation descending from former Romanian citizens may restore their citizenship under Article 11 of the law.
    </p>

    <h1>Rights and Responsibilities of New Citizens</h1>

    <h2>Rights</h2>

    <p>
      New citizens gain access to voting rights, legal protections, public services, and full participation in civic life.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>
      Citizens are expected to respect Romanian laws, contribute to community life, and engage in civic responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Loss or Renunciation of Citizenship</h2>

    <p>
      Citizenship may be renounced voluntarily or lost involuntarily under specific legal conditions.
